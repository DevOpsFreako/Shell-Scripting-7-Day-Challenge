# Shell-Scripting-7-Day-Challenge
----------------------------------
Yes Guys Yes, I have taken a 7-day challenge where I will be showcasing my existing skills while also learning new ones. 
Over the course of the challenge, we will be completing 30 tasks that will aid us in automating our daily tasks through scripting.
---------------------------------
Like I Always Say Anyone Can Write Code That A Computer Can Understand, But It Takes A Good Programmer To Write Code That Is Easily Understandable By Other Humans.
