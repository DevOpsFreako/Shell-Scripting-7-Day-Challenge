# Shell-Scripting-7-Day-Challenge
----------------------------------
Yes Guys I have taken on a 7-day challenge where I will not only be showcasing my existing skills, but also acquiring new ones. Through this challenge, we will conquer 30 tasks that will not only aid us in automating our daily tasks, but will also equip us with the tools and knowledge necessary to optimize our productivity through scripting. Let's do this!
---------------------------------
Like I Always Say Anyone Can Write Code That A Computer Can Understand, But It Takes A Good Programmer To Write Code That Is Easily Understandable By Other Humans.
